<h1>0x01. Fix my code</h1>

<p>Fix my code is a new type of project, where weâ€™ll jump into an existing code base and fix it!</p>

<p>Sometime you will know the language, sometime not.</p>

<p>Please download the repository <a href="https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01-Fix_My_Code_Challenge">
0x01-Fix_My_Code_Challenge</a> and use it as initial files for all solutions.</p>

<p>You should not recode everything, just fix it!</p>
